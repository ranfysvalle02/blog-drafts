# Meet MongoDB's CoachGTM: The AI Bot Revolutionizing Customer Success and Sales

In the world of customer success and sales, time is money. Every minute spent searching for information or solving a problem is a minute not spent engaging with customers. That's where MongoDB's CoachGTM comes in. Powered by MongoDB Atlas Vector Search, CoachGTM is an AI Slack bot designed to equip MongoDBâ€™s teams with the knowledge and expertise they need to engage with customers meaningfully.

## What is CoachGTM?

CoachGTM is more than just a bot; its is part of the MongoDB team. It utilizes an extensive knowledgebase to offer technical guidance, process assistance, and industry expertise. 

Connecting MDB technical questions to underlying business problems so that we can become more intimate with our customers thereby unlocking longer term value. 

Goals: build trust, build credibility, build champions.

## The Birth of CoachGTM

The journey of CoachGTM started when James Underhill, Director of Sales Operations and Strategy at MongoDB, asked Fabian Valle, a hacker/engineer in SalesOps, if he could create a Slackbot that could act as a technical question responder. Despite never having created a Slackbot before, Fabian, along with SK from the product side, took up the challenge. The result was a quick, value-adding solution that was well-received by the sales team. Quickly becoming a permanent member of the MongoDB ecosystem, CoachGTM continues to add value today with more features planned in the roadmap.

## The Impact of CoachGTM

CoachGTM answers thousands of questions per month, saving an estimated 20 minutes per question asked. At MongoDB, this translates into an expected $2 million in savings annually by answering over 50,000 questions for around 1000 active users in customer success and sales. 

The platform has had a significant impact on various teams across MongoDB. Customer Success Managers (CSMs) appreciate the rapid access to accurate information, enabling quick responses to customer queries. Sales representatives and account executives find that the platform helps identify customer issues quickly, enhancing deal closures. Sales engineers and solutions architects report reduced routine inquiry handling time, indicating a decrease in basic query volume.

## How CoachGTM Works

CoachGTM is powered by MongoDB Atlas Vector Search. The process involves several key technical steps:

1. **Indexing with MongoDB Atlas Vector Search:** CoachGTM creates highly efficient index vector representations of thousands of documents, including websites, pdfs, and docs. They are ingested to the index every 24 hours, ensuring the information is always up to date.

2. **Scalability and Performance Optimization:** MongoDB Atlas Vector Search is designed to handle large-scale vector data with exceptional efficiency. It seamlessly scales search infrastructure as data grows, ensuring optimal performance at all times.

3. **Hybrid Search Implementation:** CoachGTM uses a hybrid search approach that combines keyword-based searches with vector similarity searches. This approach works better than semantic search alone and boosts correct document matching by around 20%.

4. **Result Fusion and Ranking:** After the hybrid search, CoachGTM employs LLM-powered result fusion techniques to combine and rerank the search results from MongoDB Atlas that are most relevant to the query.

By harnessing the power of MongoDB Atlas Vector Search, CoachGTM delivers fast and highly relevant context to MongoDB employees, ushering in a new AI wave in revenue operations.

## The Magic of Storing Vectors and Metadata Together

One of the most powerful aspects of MongoDB Atlas Vector Search is its ability to store both vectors and associated metadata within a single document. This seamless integration eliminates the need for complex data pipelines and ensures that your data remains tightly coupled and easily accessible.

**Key Benefits:**

* **Simplified Data Management:** By storing vectors and metadata together, you can streamline your data management processes and avoid the overhead of maintaining separate data stores.
* **Enhanced Query Capabilities:** You can perform more sophisticated queries by combining vector-based searches with metadata-based filters. For example, you could search for documents that are similar to a given vector *and* have a specific tag or category.
* **Improved Data Insights:** Having vectors and metadata in a single location enables you to gain deeper insights into your data by analyzing relationships and patterns that might not be apparent when data is stored in separate silos.

**A Single Data Solution for Operational and Vector Data:**

MongoDB Atlas offers a truly unified data platform that can handle both your operational data and your vector data. This means that you can use a single toolset and infrastructure to manage all of your data, reducing complexity and costs.

**Key Advantages:**

* **Reduced Complexity:** By using a single platform, you can simplify your data architecture and avoid the need for complex data integration and synchronization processes.
* **Improved Efficiency:** A unified platform can help you to optimize your data workflows and improve overall performance.
* **Lower Costs:** By consolidating your data management infrastructure, you can reduce costs associated with hardware, software, and maintenance/integration.

## Conclusion

The ability to store vectors and metadata together in MongoDB Atlas Vector Search offers a powerful and flexible solution for managing your AI and machine learning workloads. By leveraging this capability, you can simplify your data management processes, enhance your query capabilities, and gain deeper insights into your data.
