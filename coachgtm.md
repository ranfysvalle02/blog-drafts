# Meet MongoDB's CoachGTM: The AI Bot Revolutionizing Customer Success and Sales

In the world of customer success and sales, time is money. Every minute spent searching for information or solving a problem is a minute not spent engaging with customers. That's where MongoDB's CoachGTM comes in. Powered by MongoDB Atlas Vector Search, CoachGTM is an AI Slack bot designed to equip MongoDBâ€™s teams with the knowledge and expertise they need to engage with customers meaningfully.

## What is CoachGTM?

CoachGTM is more than just a bot; it's an extension of your team. It utilizes an extensive knowledgebase to offer technical guidance, process assistance, and industry expertise. 

## The Birth of CoachGTM

The journey of CoachGTM started when James Underhill, Director of Sales Operations and Strategy at MongoDB, asked Fabian Valle, a hacker/engineer in SalesOps, if he could create a Slackbot that could act as a tech responder. Despite never having created a Slackbot before, Fabian, along with SK from the product side, took up the challenge. The result was a quick, value-adding solution that was well-received by the sales team. Quickly becoming a permanent member of the MongoDB ecosystem, CoachGTM continues to add value today with more features planned in the roadmap.

## The Impact of CoachGTM

CoachGTM answers thousands of questions per month, saving an estimated 20 minutes per question asked. At MongoDB, this translates into an expected $2 million in savings annually by answering over 50,000 questions for around 1000 active users in customer success and sales. 

The platform has had a significant impact on various teams across MongoDB. Customer Success Managers (CSMs) appreciate the rapid access to accurate information, enabling quick responses to customer queries. Sales representatives and account executives find that the platform helps identify customer issues quickly, enhancing deal closures. Sales engineers and solutions architects report reduced routine inquiry handling time, indicating a decrease in basic query volume.

## How CoachGTM Works

CoachGTM is powered by MongoDB Atlas Vector Search. The process involves several key technical steps:

1. **Indexing with MongoDB Atlas Vector Search:** CoachGTM creates highly efficient index vector representations of thousands of documents, including websites, pdfs, and docs. They are ingested to the index every 24 hours, ensuring the information is always up to date.

2. **Scalability and Performance Optimization:** MongoDB Atlas Vector Search is designed to handle large-scale vector data with exceptional efficiency. It seamlessly scales search infrastructure as data grows, ensuring optimal performance at all times.

3. **Hybrid Search Implementation:** CoachGTM uses a hybrid search approach that combines keyword-based searches with vector similarity searches. This approach works better than semantic search alone and boosts correct document matching by around 20%.

4. **Result Fusion and Ranking:** After the hybrid search, Mendable employs LLM-powered result fusion techniques to combine and rerank the search results from MongoDB Atlas that are most relevant to the query.

By harnessing the power of MongoDB Atlas Vector Search, CoachGTM delivers fast and highly relevant context to MongoDB employees, ushering in a new AI wave in revenue operations.

## Conclusion

CoachGTM is more than just a bot; it's a revolution in customer success and sales. By providing on-time technical expertise, it empowers CSMs and sales teams, fostering trust and engagement with customers. With its automated workflows, enterprise-grade security, and multilingual capabilities, CoachGTM is set to transform the way businesses interact with their customers.
