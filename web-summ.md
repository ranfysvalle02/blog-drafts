## **Intro**

**Tired of your language model struggling to grasp the big picture?** Traditional context windows, like a tiny viewing port, limit its ability to see the entire forest. This is especially frustrating when trying to summarize long, complex texts.

Text summarization is a critical task that involves condensing a large volume of text into a concise summary. This blog post will delve into a Python code snippet that employs a map-reduce strategy to summarize web content using a large language model.

## **Map-Reduce for Text Summarization**

**Understanding the Strategy**

Map-Reduce is a programming model that processes large data sets in parallel. In the context of text summarization, we can break down the task into two steps:

1. **Map:** Divide the input text into smaller chunks, and summarize each chunk individually.
2. **Reduce:** Combine the invidual summaries of these chunks into a final summary.
